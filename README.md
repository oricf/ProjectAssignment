Hello! My name is Oriana Castillo and I am a Biomedical Engineer student at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (u198686). I will leave my email here in case anyone needs to contact me: orianaalejandra.castillo01@estudiant.upf.edu

I want to introduce a project created during the second year of my degree. It is an app designed for people who are diabetic and it aims to offer a place for them to keep track of various things throughout their day like the food they consume, doctor's appointments, blood sugar levels, the medicine taken and symptoms. It also allows them to view a list of various recipes made for their diet. This app is meant to facilitate the life of those who have diabetes by giving them a place to keep track of all of the important things in their day. This way, when they have a doctor's appointment they can easily give them a report on what exactly has happened each day. An issue that was encountered when developing the project was opening up the app to different users. There are many things that need improving including the actual design of the app, adding some features like chats for the users and overall finding features that could be useful in their day to day. To make this possible I first plan on perfecting the design and adding the features mentioned and as for making it available to different users I do not have the knowledge on how to do that so I would have to learn and get help from others. 

This project was developed by two other individuals Maria Farreny and Teresa Aguila. Wwe all worked on it together end equitably. 

Here we have a few images of some of the main menu in the app and a few of the tabs you can select:

This is an app that could have a positive impact on the life of many individuals. If we can finish it and implement all of the ideas we have, I am sure many people would implement it in their day to day lives.
